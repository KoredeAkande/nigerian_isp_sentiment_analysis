"spectranet_ng your response just proves how horrid your customer service is. rather than ask what my issue is to help resolve, you render an apology. apology accepted!. now can you actually proffer solution? i am really disappointed with your services and attitude to customers"
"spectranet is just the worse tbh, i can't even watch a 5min video without serious lagging"
spectranet_ng #dontusespectranet incredibly poor network coverage and connectivity coupled with swift cellular data drain and extremely rude customer service representatives earn this cruel joke of a network a subzero rating. i definitely wouldn't recommend this excuse for a network to anyone. probably is the product of professional scammers determined to separate people from their hard-earned cash.
"buddah24 adebayorisirisi wifisupport1 tizeti you know people in abusive relationship always hope that tomorrow will be better but when tomorrow comes, the story will still be the same... so, he will still be with his lovely network tomorrow and tweet at them."
spectranet_ng isn't a worthy company anylonger.
spectranet_ng it's a disgusting customer service festac branch. was directed to mr samuel to attend to me but he chooses to go eat and host while i wait for 23 mins and counting. haven't even been told how long i will wait. internal customer service poor let alone external
therealmusty toolzo spectranet_ng baba today is double data.
nothing as frustrating as terrible network and spectranet is taking the piss right now
"adarpt37 hismyel tobiomoty daddyhassler fifaeworldcup spectranet_ng there's a process , we need to be part of that process"

"looking at my payslip and seeing how much my employer pays for my tax really get to me, like i don't benefit this amount you're paying. this amount with 2k addition could make a sub on spectranet_ng for a month i'm been abused and maltreated by this country to be paying such tax"
"ziniiex spectranet_ng hi zinnie, give me ur user id, i'll send it to my former colleagues there to help u suspend the account or better still send an email to highlighting ur user id on the subject , request for immediate suspension of account. cheers"

wifisupport1 tizeti i had made some complaints here some days back. so after the technical team fixed my issue.bthis is the current speed at off peak period. and to think i just stupidly renewed subscription today is pathetic. i can't tolerate this speed for 30days
adefola09 they said they don't have coverage at my side oo... thinking of getting ipnx
"omo i've been wallowing in ignorance,appaz my spectranet sub had elapsed 100gb and i didn't even realize and i've been ranting about bad service meanwhile they have another package for 19k that is 500gb and i've been doing 100gb for 18k e be things o"

"consumersncc wifisupport1 tizeti last week, i couldn't stream on netflix or download files.this week it has gotten so bad,i cannot see videos on social media even though the speed is suspiciously reading as fast.they claim to resolve it, two days later it goes right back. very reminiscent of nitel tossed lines."
spectranet_ng how did i go from 26gb last night to 5gb today and i supposedly have free night browsing from 1am to 7am?
spectranet_ng no wahala. thank you.
saefhenryosas spectranet_ng  those ones na scam

"spectranet_ng hello spectranet, you people called me today to advertise and remind me to top up and subscribe for another monthly data that i will have double of what i did but alas it wasn't what you guys did. you guys uploaded this list but none is found in your app."
"spectranet_ng good evening, pls what's happening, ur network just off the radar..."
i want to get tizeti. who else uses them? pls give me before i call them and part with my small money.
anenetochukwu spectranet_ng lol can't they try?
olatunjiyso adeshinahh spectranet_ng well. true. but i have suffered for too long in the hands of network providers and won't really bother if i am paying and getting the value. spectranet used to give me bonuses that i couldn't even use

"adarpt37 hismyel tobiomoty daddyhassler fifaeworldcup spectranet_ng there's a gaming association in nigeria, i think we should ask them what they are doing"

"keneswitch wifisupport1 tizeti according to their terms and conditions they promise service within 24 hours, as a customer myself i'm tired of their terrible service."
"ngcomcommission consumersncc spectranet_ng here's is to state my ordeal using spectranet_ng i renewed my spectranet subscription on the 13th of this month, and just yesterday at about 4pm, 8gb had been exhausted without heavy downloads or streaming."

"ripples143 wifisupport1 tizeti they have a lot of downtime, like a lot. they are making it seem as though it's free service. i ducking pay for this, you are not doing me a favour!! "
spectranet_ng what's up with your speeds na?
"tizeti is a special brand of useless, when it comes to this isp business. wifi dey, why am i buying mobile data to download whatsapp video fgs?"
"sheriphskills wifisupport1 to be honest, just change your provider. i used tizeti for a month and i packed it away! i have never been that disappointed at a service provider."
i'm in a toxic relationship with spectranet.
tizeti tizeti has been absolutely disappointing this last week...very erratic network...they seem not to be able to handle the work from home pressures
spectranet needs to reward me . 4 years 
"spectranet_ng hi, i collected my sister's mifi before traveling. i am not able to recharge or subscribe because i don't know the sim number, nor the user id credentials. how can you help?"
spectranet expecting me to subscribe without sending double data offer. jokers i want double data plus rollover so till then we wait.
"i'm essentially grateful for my spectranet battery strength/ health, that shit can go 9-10 hours on full charge. it's amazing"
bbnaija this is the network you are advertising on your show tizeti wifisupport1 they have a very poor service ... if you plan on doing abeg rethink cause it would end in premium tears 
ridwan_olalere tizeti i agree. 
spectranet_ng hian and i didn't get a mail notice or sms notice?? so i can subscribe now for 10k plan and get double data??
officialbambam4 spectranet_ng they lost me 2 days ago already. they're just a scam. there's no area you'll go where their internet is strong. imagine paying 13k for data and you're struggling to even send whatsapp messages. dump their network as fast as you can if you want peace of mind. e go be for them sha
wifisupport1 tizeti well done ooo ... 2 hours to download 9mb .. but na broadband .. 
obadeyemi data that you're not using is disappearing . spectranet_ng has to be a joke honestly. #spectranetdown
"spectranet_ng spectranet_ng spectranet_ng don't make me useless and ineffective again today. 10 hours gone, yet nothing meaningful has been achieved. fix this network, or else. #spectranet #bringbackmynetwork #spectranet #bringbackmynetwork #spectranet #bringbackmynetwork"

"after more than 21 minutes of call, wifisupport1 tizeti didn't pick my call. have you guys blacklisted my number? anyway, as usual, the internet is bad again and unusable. please help us adjust it like you did the last time. since it's your delight that we beg you every time"
"onioyewole1 spectranet_ng baba, be like you go gimme some of this ya oxygen oooo. i need air"
gue_varo drjoeabah islimfit spectranet_ng why were you shocked?
"torh i don't know. once i connect my spectranet to my laptop like this that's like 2gb gone (within 20 mins), i worked from home through out this week with my hotspot and my data is still much"
daslimfop spectranet_ng i've started exploring other options tbh. 10k monthly in this economy is no joke....i can't be paying that much and not even enjoy what i'm paying for. their usefulness in the past couple of weeks has been reducing on a daily basis.
ganji118 officialbambam4 spectranet_ng i agree
does your sim card work on phones? spectranet_ng

spectranet_ng good day please i will like to know how strong is your network in alapere area of lagos state. oriola axis to be precise
is spectranet doing 100% today?
"the network reception happens to be very poor in the onike area of lagos and a tizeti representative advised that we apply for a refund via mail . (series of emails have been sent , but tizeti haven't done the needful )"
"drjoeabah spectranet_ng i'm currently building a business... several hours of planning and designing on paper... the only thing that is certain is how i will make sure that i do everything i've promised my customers. i can't live with it, i wonder how these companies do it. teeniken"
spectranet_ng definitely needs to pay for this pain and suffering they've put me through in the past month. i spend an average of 45k every two months for this trash internet.
cchukudebelu spectranet_ng huawei
omo my network no go since morning both airtel and tizeti can't even recharge my 9mobile
eyitayofajinmi spectranet_ng very poor coverage in ikate. very poor 
spectranet has been terrible
"spectranet_ng globacomnigeria i have sent you something on the frustrating experience through your seflcare portal after several complaints and a visit to your bode thomas office. pls fix it today and forever...otherwise, i port"
"jideofod rikko007 wifisupport1 tizeti that's because they boarded too much customer in march when lockdown was in effect. they didn't increase capacity, they keep lying about things that are not."
spectranet_ng you owe me 10gb
"atoyebibamidel2 dzinkuz drjoeabah spectranet_ng ntelng my brother, if you stay in lagos invite me to come this weekend. i'm telling you what i know, it's capped. even ask their customer care."
another good day to remind y'all that spectranet_ng is trash
tizeti my internet is still not working. you are costing my money. i've had to subscribe on my other internet since saturday and i know how much i have spent.

"spectranet_ng what kind of service is #spectranet_ng delivering nowadays? it's been a week since i've had any network service on any of my devices (cpe & mini) at #yaba, onike precisely. multiple calls to the customer care lines, but just empty promises to look into it. shame!"
bumbabilii spectranet baby lool
"customer reps over the phone spectranet_ng, usually hv helpful responses, but today, twas like both ladies i spoke with had awful meetings with their boss. it's funny how they end the call with ""thank you for choosing spectranet"" without even letting me finish m_customerfirst"
spectranet_ng what is going on?? where is my data?
companies in the same useless category during this quarantine period:  nepa aka phcn phcnnigeria  spectranet_ng very useless.

"more than15 hours without social media. spectranet_ng did the most with their shitty network today. literally haven't done any efficient work all day. then iphone reset did its own too, taking me back to january cos of icloud misbehaviour.  i forgive you all."
savvyrinu i would have recommended spectranet but they are terribly slow of late
spectranet's network has been terrible. every thing is a problem in this country.
i have finally been delivered from spectranet! thank you lord

"caxtonjp sirwolx tizeti my thoughts exactly. look me now wey no dey do dstv, i am solely a data guy, these ucl nights, i had my spectranet and airtel on at the same time. laptop on airtel, tv on spectranet. omo airtel just dey stream smooth, spectranet na wa. it was frustrating."
"according to spectranet, if you stay around awoyaya, lakowe, bogije and beyond you are not on lagos map "
"tizeti your network is trash... i can't open any website, netflix can't load on the tv. phew"

khidkhordi that website be acting like an amber alert though. like a sign of things to come. at least tizeti get fine ui
ycombinator kananyi socialcapital mwseibel ace_company only tizeti offers a 4g internet service that cannot even load whatsapp status. there's not one single thing this telecom service provides but mediocrity. top notch mediocrity
"deejay_klem smilecomsng well this means i will stick with spectranet_ng . sigh, the devil you know."
