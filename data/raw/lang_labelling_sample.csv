"Shame on you @ntelng @ntelcare you guys promised over 60Mbps and look at what I am getting at a location close to UNILAG. I did rather just switch to 
@Spectranet_NG
"
@Spectranet_NG  please can one add a new mifi device to an existing spectranet account?
Let me just transfer money for my next subscription to my Spectranet purse before story will enter...
"@wifisupport1 @NgComCommission @cenbank It’s over a week now and still the same stupid excuse while my money keeps running.
@NgComCommission you need to look out for the consumers. Wifi/Tizeti is a daylight robbery Organisation by taking subscribers subscription and not providing service they promise to deliver."
@Spectranet_NG good evening. I mistakenly subscribed for 40GB nite plan instead of 40GB unified! Please is there a way to rectify this? I need an urgent response
"Back to Spectranet after NTEL almost shamed me.

I know it will till end in hot tears, but hot tears is better than crying blood."
"*All payments can be done on the app(Dstv, Gotv, Smile, Swift, Spectranet, PHCN etc) 
* You can also purchase data and airtime  of all networks on the app https://t.co/i0GjOjTGn9"
"I want to get TIZETI.

Who else uses them?

Pls give me before I call them and part with my small money."
@Dipz_Avi @Spectranet_NG Even their data speed has been horrible 🤦🏽‍♂️
Not tizeti using zepeto videos for ads 😂😂😂
@juvilplus @MTN180 @madu_victor @tizeti Kfb
"@fimiletoks @mickey2ya @graffiti06 Tizeti is not scam o!

They are the most gigantic scam. 

Dey show me fefe."
@wifisupport1 @tizeti network still down in festac ooo. And I have done all the troubleshooting. Came up for a few minutes yesterday and then stopped working. Please bear in mind the number of days I've not been able to use your internet. Thank you.
"@tizeti fix this, can’t watch Netflix"
@Spectranet_NG what's up with your speeds na?
"@eronmose1e @moyesparkle @whittyyumees @Spectranet_NG My brother all na scam but you see that spectranet ehn na sinzu them be, they Dey scam die! Internet speed self has been horrible 🤦🏽‍♂️"
@bols_bols1 @Spectranet_NG You are special na
I have moved from Spectranet to smile to Airtel in the last 6 months but they are all trash. They are only good in the first month.
@abiolahydee @Spectranet_NG @SLEKSTAR Thank you
"I will find out a suitable replacement to @tizeti very soon and I will tell you people to come take your equipment out of my premises even though I paid for that shit.

Don't worry I will stop complaining very soon."
"@Spectranet_NG what else do we do? After 5 days we made payment to your Zenith bank account and evidence of payment supplied with numerous call to your agents, still our 20 user IDs are not activated. Shall we stop making use of you? Other vendors don't give us issues."
@SkinnyTobi @iChopTweets @onuoha_jessica @DrJoeAbah @Spectranet_NG @tizeti 😂😂 until you can’t use your data to browse
"I have to Continously switch between glo and spectranet.
Netflix takes forever to load movies, its draining. https://t.co/l05AFrdGf9"
"@Tukooldegreat Baba spectranet na scam, the 100gb finishes in 1 week, not as if I use the data to watch porn 😔"
This Spectranet is so shit I’m gonna so regret buying. Very shitty service and I thought Smile was worse 🤦🏽‍♂️
Is today double data @Spectranet_NG
Fucking spectranet gas be shit since the lockdown started.
@oluwa_toomisin @Olubaba60 @dejokecarew @Modele_ @Spectranet_NG I guess I was unlucky
@Cohannnnn @gboukzi @Spectranet_NG Ah. That's fucked up.
@kelonline Ipnx oh
416kb/s average download speed. Spectranet is trash
"Calculated my spectranet usage and according to them I have used 20gb but on calculating myself it was 12gb with 8gb unaccounted for @Spectranet_NG reply your email.
Thank you."
"@NgComCommission @ConsumersNCC @Spectranet_NG waiting, responded that I should call back. My question is how did 8GB got exhausted without Heavy downloads or streaming? I demand an answer, this was the same reason I stopped using my Spectranet account since August last year."
@CaxtonJP @Prima_311 @wifisupport1 @NgComCommission @cenbank @channelstv @ClassicFM973 @jimidisu @ChicoRockx @NGRSenate @SaharaReporters see mail thread. We are been scammed by Tizeti/Wifi.com. No service after payment.i have been without service for over three weeks and nobody has bothered to reach out or resolve my issues
Spectranet 🤝 your internet connection is unstable (during Zoom calls)
"@Spectranet_NG Can you people stop sending me sms and mails? I am not doing again, it’s not by force. Nigeria is already hard enough. topinjay@gmail.com that’s it, remove me from your mailing list. Thank you"
@wifisupport1 @tizeti Oladapo famuyide
"@theonlyebuka @AirtelNigeria @Spectranet_NG Swift, here I come 🙌🏻"
Spectranet can take this thing and throw it away 🤦🏿‍♂️
"@aboyowa_e @Spectranet_NG Lmaoo! Na so, turn up!!"
"@Spectranet_NG , see no make me swear for you! Fix your wacky internet connection around Yaba!"
@Spectranet_NG  is crap https://t.co/B6Gbc6x9gl
"@MassiveMatthew @Spectranet_NG Sorry, welcome to Nigeria."
@uglycreator_ I haven’t used spectranet yet
@itohan94 @suzyonce_ Try using Spectranet. It’s better
Spectranet 🤧😭
"@ngozi_nkeChinwe Okay. But you do realize said SP is also affecting Ife’s business too? 

Do a search of Spectranet and see what the results will churn out. Everyone is complaining which means they’re not getting their act right and most brands in Nigeria only perform when called out"
@_miamorr_ Spectranet doesn’t share data
@Spectranet_NG Not all of us can. Some of us are working in the essential services sector.
Spectranet and MTN I dunno who is worse. Horrible ass networks
Before tizeti will scam serah now
@rihanat_sona @LolaBnr @Spectranet_NG solves this problem really
@Niyitheziner Buy spectranet
@ParadiseKelechi @mykeels @Spectranet_NG It gets really slow these days
..but after 2 days I'll be struggling to even send messages on WhatsApp. Your network here is so poor that even being on the 3rd floor of a 3-storey building doesn't improve things and it's looking like dumping your network is the solution to get a faster internet @Spectranet_NG
"I didn't once check my spectranet data balance last month.

Maybe this on site job thing isn't so bad"
Spectranet! Free unlimited data from 1am to 7am. Thank me later https://t.co/MLx2qgfXUI
"@wifisupport1 @itueng @tizeti @netflix kindly activate our account ‘Laoye Abimbola’ Masha, Surulere. Paid 27/06/19. Support #649947 Paystack ref T217238200870816. It has not been activated since 27/6/19. Lost 2days already."
"MTNN @MTNNG  and spectranet if you guys are not going to dash us data atleast come correct on your services.
We can't be wasting money in these glorious times."
"More than15 hours without Social Media. @Spectranet_NG did the most with their shitty network today. Literally haven’t done any efficient work all day. 
Then iPhone reset did its own too, taking me back to January cos of iCloud misbehaviour. 🤦🏽‍♀️

I forgive you all."
"According to Spectranet, if you stay around Awoyaya, Lakowe, Bogije and beyond you are not on Lagos map 🤔🤔🤔"
Is there a place where Tizeti works perfect? Where constant speed is up to 5mbps ⬆️⬇️
Why is spectranet messing up like this
Can’t believe I have spent over 12hrs and still counting  just to download this Ghost Recon: Wildlands with file size of 67gb 🤦🏽‍♂️... Spectranet 👎🏾
Dear @Spectranet_NG kindly reply DM
@rakspd You no see as I dey complain of @Spectranet_NG since
Tizeti have decided not to come install my internet @tizeti
"I went for this was because I found I was using up Spectranet's 100GB fair-usage cap on its ""unlimited"" data plan in less than two weeks.

More than once, I've paid 18k for it, twice in a month."
@Shokunbi23 Have you tried Spectranet.....they are good offers for Abuja
"@wifisupport1 @alhaji_biggi @BBNaija @tizeti @heyiwhunmmy I have been laying this complain like forvever y’all keep asking for the same thing and sayimg the same thing even Rudy’s with zero improvement... your network is being worked on bla bla , it has been restored bla bla , same thing all over again bla bla bla ..."
Spectranet would not allow me to be great 😕
@amarachimex @Spectranet_NG You mind dem?? No network all evening. This is unacceptable!! @NgComCommission do something.
"Eriq, i assume?
First of all accept my humble apology, i didn't mean to sound rude to you but take me as a case study I sub spectranet 18k unlimited (which is a lie) monthly cause of my TV and phones.
I hate to check every now and then my data balance all i want to know is expiry"
"@tizeti  you guys are aware, calling your customer service is not free toll or is it a strategy to discourage customers from calling. Nobody picks"
"@tizeti Please note your network has been down for an hour now.

Awoyaya, Eputu area.

Please fix this problem ASAP!"
"@Iceugwa @Spectranet_NG Lol, maybe it's a new policy or maybe there is some form of eligibility."
"@lawaleto @Spectranet_NG I dey bro, you get fast internet ?"
