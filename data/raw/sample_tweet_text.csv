My family used my spectranet and they don't want to help my ministry now it has finished. @Spectranet_NG abeg how will I change my password.
@Spectranet_NG How can I get the freedom mifi in Ajah today https://t.co/CWet1AR3Vd
@DrOlufunmilayo @iconic_remi @Spectranet_NG
"Look at my @tizeti speed, do you think I’m bothered about that 5G talk? https://t.co/d760OWS9up"
"@Spectranet_NG Your response just proves how horrid your customer service is. Rather than ask what my issue is to help resolve, you render an apology. Apology accepted!. Now can you actually proffer solution? I am really disappointed with your services and attitude to customers"
"Spectranet is just the worse tbh, I can’t even watch a 5min video without serious lagging😫😫😫🤦🏽‍♂️"
@Spectranet_NG #dontusespectranet Incredibly poor network coverage and connectivity coupled with swift cellular data drain and extremely rude customer service representatives earn this cruel joke of a network a subzero rating. I definitely wouldn't recommend this excuse for a network to anyone. Probably is the product of professional scammers determined to separate people from their hard-earned cash.
"@buddah24 @AdebayOrisirisi @wifisupport1 @tizeti You know people in abusive relationship always hope that tomorrow will be better but when tomorrow comes, the story will still be the same... So, he will still be with his lovely network tomorrow and tweet at them."
@Spectranet_NG  isn't a worthy company anylonger.
"@Spectranet_NG 

It’s a disgusting customer service Festac  branch.

Was directed to Mr Samuel to attend to me but he chooses to go eat and host while I wait for 23 mins and counting. Haven’t even been told how long I will wait.

Internal customer service poor let alone external"
@TheRealMusty @ToolzO @Spectranet_NG Baba today is double data.
Nothing as frustrating as terrible network and Spectranet is taking the piss right now
"@adarpt37 @hismyel @tobiomoty @DaddyHassler @FIFAeWorldCup @Spectranet_NG There's a process , we need to be part of that process"
Airtel and Tizeti have failed me #AJRuiz2 #AnthonyJoshua
@shawttynatt Even Glo and Airtel. If not for Spectranet that is doing the rescue.
Cant even get internet to do my work 🤡🤡🤡🤡👿 @tizeti
@DigitalTrends @Spectranet_NG how far? are we going to get this in Nigeria?
"Looking at my payslip and seeing how much my employer pays for my tax really get to me, like I don't benefit this amount you're paying.
This amount with 2k addition could make a sub on @Spectranet_NG for a month
I'm been abused and maltreated by this country to be paying such tax"
"@Ziniiex @Spectranet_NG Hi zinnie, give me ur user Id, I’ll send it to my former colleagues there to help u suspend the account or better still send an email to care@spectranet.com.ng highlighting ur user ID on the subject , request for immediate suspension of account. Cheers"

Pls consider them instead."
"@wifisupport1 @tizeti 
I had made some complaints here some days back. So after the technical team fixed my issue.bthis is the current speed at off peak period. And to think I just stupidly renewed subscription today is pathetic. I can't tolerate this speed for 30days"
@adefola09 They said they don’t have coverage at my side oo... thinking of getting ipnx
"Omo
I've been wallowing in ignorance,appaz my spectranet sub had elapsed 100gb and I didn't even realize and I've been ranting about bad service meanwhile they have another package for 19k that is 500gb and I've been doing 100gb for 18k

Very reminiscent of nitel tossed lines."
@Spectranet_NG how did I go from 26gb last night to 5gb today and I supposedly have free night browsing from 1am to 7am?
"@Spectranet_NG No wahala.
Thank you."
@SaefhenryOsas @Spectranet_NG 🤣🤣 those ones na scam 🤣
@Spectranet_NG please can you confirm if I have double data deal on my device?
"@Spectranet_NG hello Spectranet, you people called me today to advertise and remind me to top up and subscribe for another monthly data that I will have double of what I did but alas it wasn’t what you guys did. You guys uploaded this list but none is found in your app. https://t.co/cBIfIl7spC"
"@Spectranet_NG Good evening, pls what's happening, ur network just off the radar..."
"I want to get TIZETI.

Who else uses them?

Pls give me before I call them and part with my small money."
@AneneTochukwu @Spectranet_NG LOL can't they try?
@OlatunjiYso @adeshinaHH @Spectranet_NG Well. True. But I have suffered for too long in the hands of network providers and won’t really bother if I am paying and getting the value. Spectranet used to give me bonuses that I couldn’t even use 🤷🏿‍♂️
Spectranet 😡🤬
"@adarpt37 @hismyel @tobiomoty @DaddyHassler @FIFAeWorldCup @Spectranet_NG There's a gaming association in Nigeria, I think we should ask them what they are doing"

Hello @Spectranet_NG what does the online mean ? https://t.co/SYrGo4kKWW
@tizeti I really can’t believe this is happening! It’s bad and sad for your business. Please look at it urgently . It’s been happening for days now and I felt it’s unlike your services

I’m in a toxic relationship with spectranet.
@tizeti Tizeti has been absolutely disappointing this last week...very erratic network...they seem not to be able to handle the work from home pressures
"Spectranet needs to reward me 😭😭.
4 years 😭"
"@Spectranet_NG Hi, 
I collected my sister's mifi before traveling. I am not able to recharge or subscribe because I don't know the SIM number, nor the user id credentials. How can you help?"
Spectranet expecting me to subscribe without sending double data offer. Jokers I want double data plus rollover so till then we wait.
"I'm essentially grateful for my spectranet battery strength/ health, that shit can go 9-10 hours on full charge. It's amazing"
@BBNaija this is the network you are advertising on your show @tizeti @wifisupport1 they have a very poor service ... if you plan on doing abeg rethink cause it would end in premium tears 😭 https://t.co/QRgOBulEUI

@officialbambam4 @Spectranet_NG They lost me 2 days ago already. They're just a scam. There's no area you'll go where their internet is strong. Imagine paying 13k for data and you're struggling to even send WhatsApp messages. Dump their network as fast as you can if you want peace of mind. E go be for them sha
