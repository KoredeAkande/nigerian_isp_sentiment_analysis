"@Spectranet_NG , una give us 1GB and take speed, pls take your 1GB and return back the speed."

@Khaleed_ng @MBuhari @jidesanwoolu We go tag @jack  and @Spectranet_NG
"@wifisupport1 @NgComCommission @cenbank It’s over a week now and still the same stupid excuse while my money keeps running.

Pls consider them instead."
"@tizeti This is the problem with Nigerian businesses.

@OlatunjiYso @adeshinaHH @Spectranet_NG Well. True. But I have suffered for too long in the hands of network providers and won’t really bother if I am paying and getting the value. Spectranet used to give me bonuses that I couldn’t even use 🤷🏿‍♂️

Someone should make me happy by paying for my spectranet subscription 😭😭😭
Spectranet has been wonderfully terrible this week.
"@ITSDJPRETTIBOI @No_Guile That's not an unlimited plan.

Can you tell which of the speed tests below is Mobile and which is WiFi? #wifi.com.ng https://t.co/NIYhAhpt8Q"

Please dears, Save a soul. 🙏🏽"
@Techpointdotng @TheEnike @tizeti Smoooth
@tizeti @netflix Watch what?!! Crappy network. I use it. Terrible service. You don’t pick your calls +234 908 749 3040 which is very expensive. When you pick the care guys are clueless about everything relating to your operations and are always escalating without results. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Smile or Spectranet?? Good people which one do you prefer and why??
@Officialkome_ @Spectranet_NG This people don frustrate me finish kai. I’m tired
@AtoyebiBamidel2 @dzinkuz @DrJoeAbah @Spectranet_NG @ntelng Lmaooo... That waa before. It's capped now
"@wifisupport1 @tizeti 
Now am enjoying what I paid for. Kudos 

#EndSARS"
@TripleO_G @sammiestarks @Spectranet_NG But they said no cap 😭😭
@Spectranet_NG Had to switch to my mobile network to send this tweet.
"Coming soon 🙌🙌

Spectranet don’t you feel like doing double day ta? 🌚🌚
@Qadis_ She must be working for Spectranet cuz that’s the only explanation for that tweet

No issues whatsoever"
@wifisupport1 @tizeti After making me pay 12500 instead of 9500
@FurtherMaf F*ck Tizeti IPNX Way!!!!!!
@Spectranet_NG wiped out 15GB of data in 2days on a line associated with a POS Device that has an average daily traffic of about 30mb. I have asked for concrete details of what happened from the 29th till today before taking further action.  @NgComCommission
@J_Anowa @Spectranet_NG They are crazy. 2014 was the last time I used them.

"@ajepintos Lol. I give up fam. 

Tizeti is useless"
Is there any Internet Service Provider in Nigeria that offers Unlimited data for a month with NO CAP ? Asides Tizeti please
"Double data recharge on Spectranet. Get double the amount for today recharge only...

#truth761x @ Lagos, Nigeria https://t.co/pQILhhvMoh"
"I went for this was because I found I was using up Spectranet's 100GB fair-usage cap on its ""unlimited"" data plan in less than two weeks.

More than once, I've paid 18k for it, twice in a month."
@LadeTawak @Spectranet_NG Nope... Not just you... Same thing on my end
Glos bulk subscription is a bloody scam. Money I should have used to buy spectranet 😢😢
@Spectranet_NG how can I renew my EVO mifi. I can't access your branch offices now. I think there should be a way I can sub withy credit card
@tizeti @wifisupport1 is this how you guys want to add to our stay at home Covid-19ation? Fluctuating and frustrating connectivity?
"Renewing my subscription for my Spectranet Evo Mifi rn has to be the worst decision I have taken today. 
Whatever ""reset"" signal with the arrow your customer care rep said is next to it doesn't exist on mine. 

@Spectranet_NG"
Dear @mypaga @mypagacare I made payment to refill my @Spectranet_NG account through your platform since 10.31am using my @gtbank @gtbank_help and am yet to get my account updated or get a refund. Kindly assist to process transaction urgently so I can renew my account urgently.
Tizeti pls now 😭
@Spectranet_NG = 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩
@papishow You still dey use Spectranet?
"That Spectranet money pain me sha, but just had to!!"
"@KhidKhordi That website be acting like an amber alert though. Like a sign of things to come.
At least tizeti get fine UI"
@ifedigbo @tizeti @NgComCommission They wouldn’t come. They have crazy individuals working for them. They would call you to say they are coming and change course without recourse to you. Bunch of time wasters
"@ycombinator @kananyi @socialcapital @mwseibel @ACE_company 

Only @Tizeti https://t.co/lqJDcYhnOI offers A 4G internet service that cannot even load WhatsApp status. There’s not one single thing this telecom service provides but mediocrity. Top notch mediocrity"
@yforyemi Spectranet?
"Lmaooooooooooo I’m overflowing data, Spectranet and Smile loves me 😭😭😭🥰"
@Spectranet_NG you guys should do double data today naa 😩😩
"@UcheSwish Perfumes, Spectranet, Chocolate, Phone cases etc"

Spectranet is rubbish"
"@tizeti, Please, what's happening nah?"
@christikeyes Spectranet
@Spectranet_NG When is 100% bonus offer pls
"This is me putting it out there.
If anyone is reading this and is thinking of buying @Spectranet_NG mifi, please look for some other company to patronize.
They are simply untrustworthy and should I say inept or irresponsible?
I was warned about their unprofessionalism. Sad. https://t.co/SWq9ODIt0b"
@Rockstarvique Sigh. I guess I’d have to stick to Spectranet.
"@Bolaji___ @tizeti This is why I was reluctant to post this.

People will flood their service and it'll become poor 😂"
"@wifisupport1 @alhaji_biggi @BBNaija @tizeti @heyiwhunmmy I have been laying this complain like forvever y’all keep asking for the same thing and sayimg the same thing even Rudy’s with zero improvement... your network is being worked on bla bla , it has been restored bla bla , same thing all over again bla bla bla ..."

SPECTRANET is just a BIG SCAM!
Spectranet seems not to be a good buy anymore.. they are jonzing big time.
"Name a scam:

@tizeti @netflix @TundeIrukera @fccpcnigeria Thank you. They have responded and acted accordingly. #Ijaya 🙌🏿🙌🏿😃
"@Kuvuki24 @tizeti They probably had plans to increase it anyway. Just hid under the VAT. How 3k increment is no where near the 2% VAT increment. The service is not so great and if they keep this up, I’m leaving them."
@officialbambam4 @Spectranet_NG For now Airtel but I heard Ntel is cool so I should try them out this week.
I just realized ym spectranet won't work on Kano. Yikes

"@DrJoeAbah @Spectranet_NG Doc, do try @SmileComsNG with their truly unlimited Premium plan (if you have good signal at your house)."
"Spectranet has frustrated me today 
Mtn too
No network atall"
@Shamsiyya__ We use Spectranet at home and it is off the chain
@Spectranet_NG what the hell is wrong with you people? How can I be paying about 13k for internet and I'll be struggling to send WhatsApp messages? What kind of fraud is this? And if we make complaints you people will just ignore. You guys are obviously a scam.
"Eriq, i assume?
First of all accept my humble apology, i didn't mean to sound rude to you but take me as a case study I sub spectranet 18k unlimited (which is a lie) monthly cause of my TV and phones.
I hate to check every now and then my data balance all i want to know is expiry"

- You renewed my account with 60GB instead of 120GB against your proposed offer

- You owe me 60GB."
"Is it a bad thing that I gave Spectranet my number? 

These people are calling, texting and sending mails to me like I’m owing them data. 
I’ll block one number another one will call. I’m not doing again ooo

Ahahaha..."
"So i have Spectranet, Smile and now just added swift...

This lockdown cannot lock me out due to annoying internet service providers."

I couldn’t decide which Spectranet bundle to renew to. Then I remembered my precious FaceTime calls with the most adorable toddler in the world and it was case closed.
