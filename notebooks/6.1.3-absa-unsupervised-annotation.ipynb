    "# Modeling: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis [Simplistic]\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Goal:`** \n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct ABSA using word relatedness and out-of-the-box [ABSA package by ScalaConsultants](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis). This notebook is meant to serve as a start for tweet aspect annotation by getting as much of the aspects indicated and their corresponding sentiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Results will be crosschecked during the annotation phase!\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Process:`** \n",
    "1. List aspects (e.g. speed, price, reliability) determined from earlier data annotation phase\n",
    "2. Get nouns, adjectives and adverbs from the tweets as these will likely be the parts of speech making meaningful reference to aspects\n",
    "3. Check if each of the words from step 2 is very similar to any of the aspects (e.g. speed [aspect] and fast [word in tweet]) by computing relatedness score (via word embedding)\n",
    "4. If relatedness score is past a set thresholdhood, we assume the aspect was referenced in the tweet. Hence, note down that the aspect category was referenced in that given tweet and also note down the word (herein called aspect term) that implied the aspect\n",
    "6. Conduct ABSA using the ABSA package with the tweet and with the aspect term and note sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) towards the main aspect (price, speed, etc.)\n",
    "7. If multiple words make reference to a single aspect, find the average of their sentiments and use to assign a single sentiment "
